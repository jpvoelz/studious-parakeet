# Practicing Data Structures & Algorithms
This repository is for practice implementing data structures and algorithms, mostly in Python and C++. Here is what I have implemented so far:

Divide and Conquer
- Counting inversions in an array
- Karatsuba multiplication
- Quicksort

Graphs
- Karger randomized min cut algorithm
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, with Monte Carlo simulation over random graphs
